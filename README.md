# SPFolderDownloader
Simple CMD app to download folder (With all subfolder) from SharePoint Document Library
Based on .NET 4.7.2 to work with legacy SP instances. Specially with 2010-2013 SP OnPrem that doesen't allow to download directly a folder from th UI.

Provided code works ONLY with OnPrem version because of the authentication based on Network Credential.

## Next Steps
* Make download location selectable programmatically
* Make this work also with SharePoint Online
* Basic Windows UI
